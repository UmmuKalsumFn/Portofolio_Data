Using dataset sources from World Bank and Tableau for data visualization

## Questions
**Case Study : Business Analytics in the Energy Industry**
###### 
We will explore data from the World Bank, namely the World Development Indicator in 2018, which contains various indicators. 
This dataset contains various indicators ranging from population, energy, internet access, to health from various countries. 
We will be specific to the case of energy and its impact. 
However, we will be working on a specific case study with the aim of creating a data visualization as follows:

1. Which countries have the highest CO2 emissions?
2. Does energy usage go hand in hand with CO2 emissions?
3. Which countries have the highest internet usage?
